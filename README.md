# Black Box
Black Box is, so far, a very a simple puzzle game, written using rust+amethyst.
I have no intentions to keep it simple, it's just very early in development.
This will probably become gradually weirder and more artsy, but as it stands
now, it's a prototype.

The basic idea is that the player is given a box with buttons on it, but not
given any instructions for using it or an explanation of what the buttons do.
On every level, the player must figure out how the new box works, and then use
that knowledge to perform a desired output.

### Plans
As typical for me, this project is fairly ambitious, but I've learend from past
mistakes and tried to limit the scope somewhat.
I also don't want to give too many plans away here to avoid spoilers.
I will say that I hope to...
- make it 3d
- make it polished
- make it accessible
- make it weird and artsy
- give it a story

And, if legion ever gets merged to amethyst...
- port it to legion
